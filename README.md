# Ballot Initiative Slide Deck

The Ballot Initiative Slide Deck is intended for presentations to familiarize others with the Ballot Initiative repository, it's contents, and it's goals.

The slide deck is created with [Marp](https://marp.app/) which converts markdown to an html file that can be hosted online.

The contents of the slide deck can be found in ```ballot-initiative.md```

To compile to the index.html file use the command ```marp --html --theme graph_paper.css ballot-initiative.md -o index.html```
